History:

The source code in this directory was Transferred from General Dynamics (original developer)
and was updated to CSM 3.0.1.  Because of a loss of the contract, it was picked up by the 
SGC (IAI).  The version from GD was picked up by MSP (BAE) and modified from the original source
in order to fix issues and was delievered on 09/20/2013.

The build structure was then modified by IAI and consists of the following:

1) VTS Build
	a) Windows Visual Studio 2008 - open VTS_Build20008.sln
	b) GUI Tool - run .\GUI\build.xml using Ant

2) Other platforms still need to be looked at including releases for:
	a) gcc
	b) IRIX
	c) Linux
	d) SunOS
	e) Other Runtimes for Windows (currently VS2010 and VS2012, VS2003 no longer supported)


For a complete build in Visual Studio, open the corresponding solution file and perform the following:

	a) Build both Debug and Release modes
	b) From the command prompt, type buildGUI.bat

This will create both Release and Debug solutions that can be run either from the 
command line or the GUI.  If you wish to use the GUI, change directory to the 
corresponding directory (Release or Debug) and type / select "run_vts.bat"
